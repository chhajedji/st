Patches
-------

- [Alpa focus highlight](https://st.suckless.org/patches/alpha_focus_highlight/) - Different transparency for focused window.
- [Box Draw](https://st.suckless.org/patches/boxdraw/) - Custom rendering of lines/blocks/braille characters for gapless alignment.
- [Scrollback](https://st.suckless.org/patches/scrollback/) - Add keyboard scroll back feature. All patches present on page are applied.
- [font2](https://st.suckless.org/patches/font2/) - Adds fallback fonts. **Be sure to use proper fallback font as `st` crashes when rendering gylph/special symobls. A good fallback font for this purpose could be [Symbola](https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/symbola).**
- [hidecursor](https://st.suckless.org/patches/hidecursor/) - Hides cursor when typing.
